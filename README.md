# Zero to Nix

[Zero to Nix][site] is an unofficial and opinionated guide to getting started with [Nix] from [Determinate Systems][detsys].

## Setup

Make sure that you have Nix and [direnv] installed, then:

```shell
# Activate Nix shell environment
direnv allow

# Recommended
alias npm=pnpm
```

## Developing the site

### Run locally

To run the site in development mode (with live reload when you make changes):

```shell
dev
```

To run the site in preview mode (with a static web server and no live reload):

```shell
preview

# Alternatively
nix run
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000.

### Build locally

To ensure that the site can build properly in response to changes:

```shell
build
```

### Format code

To ensure that everything is properly formatted:

```shell
format
```

## Publishing

The Zero to Nix site is automatically published on [Vercel], which also provides deploy previews for pull requests.

## Technologies

Zero to Nix's "stack" ðŸ¥ž:

- [Ã®les][iles] for content management and site generation
- [Vue] for templating
- [MDX] for content
- [Tailwind] for CSS

## MDX components

The site uses a number of custom [MDX] components to spice up the usual Markdown content.

## Page metadata

For [quick start pages](./src/pages/start/):

- `title`
- `summary` (an array of things that the user will accomplish in the guide)
- `order` (ascending)

For [concept pages](./src/pages/concepts/):

- `title`
- `snippet` (a brief explanation of the concept that appears in pop-ups)
- `related` (an array of IDs representing concept pages, like `flakes` or `nix-store`)
- `readMore` (an array of links to external sources, such as official docs)

## Site logic

There are a few other important files you should be aware of when working on the site:

- [`src/app.ts`](./src/app.ts) defines global page metadata
- [`src/site.ts`](./src/site.ts) defines site-level values, like the title, description, navbar links, and more.
- [`src/logic/content.ts`](./src/logic/content.ts) provides the content management logic for the site (type-safe page frontmatter, functions to fetch and sort documents, and more)
- [`src/logic/state.ts`](./src/logic/state.ts) defines all stateful logic using the [nanostores] library
- [`src/logic/theme.ts`](./src/logic/theme.ts) provides logic for the light/dark theme switcher
