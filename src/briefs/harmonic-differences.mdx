Harmonic differs from the [official Nix installer][official] in several important ways:

1. It installs Nix with [flake support][flakes] and the `nix-command` feature already enabled rather than requiring users to enable those features.
1. It stores a *receipt* for the install process at `/nix/receipt.json`. This receipt enables Harmonic to seamlessly uninstall Nix, whereas the official Nix installer provides no offboarding path of this kind.
1. Much like [Terraform], Harmonic enables you to [plan] your installation using the `harmonic plan` command to see what Harmonic will do. We see this as an improvement over the Nix installer, which prompts you to approve changes but doesn't present *all* changes.
1. Harmonic is written in [Rust] rather than a shell scripting language (the official installer is written in [Bash]). This has two key benefits:
    1. It makes Harmonic more portable across platforms.
    1. It enables Harmonic to parallelize CPU-intensive tasks, which can't be achieved in a language like Bash.
1. If the installation fails along the way for some reason, Harmonic can use its receipt to revert the changes that it has made, minimizing the likelihood that the Nix installation process leaves your system in an undesirable state.
