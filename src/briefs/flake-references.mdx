All Nix flakes are identified by a two-part "address" that signals where they're located:

<FlakeReferences />

### Prefixes

The table below shows which prefixes are available:

<FlakeReferencePrefixes />

<Info title="Exceptions">
There are two important exceptions to the path prefix rules in the table above:

1. The path `nixpkgs` doesn't require a prefix and is equivalent to `github:NixOS/nixpkgs`.
1. You can use absolute filepaths without a `path` prefix, for example `/Users/nix-user/nix-stuff`.
