A _Nix channel_ is a mechanism used by the legacy Nix CLI to keep [Nixpkgs] up to date.
In the new Nix CLI, channels have been replaced by [flakes].

## How do channels work?

A channel is a URL that points to some Nix code, such as `https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable`.
As a convenience, you can also use the URL syntax `channel:{name}`, which is expanded by Nix to `https://nixos.org/channels/{name}`.

You can configure Nix to fetch a channel automatically:

```shell title="Add a channel"
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable
```

You can then run this to have Nix fetch all channels that you've configured:

```shell title="Update all channels"
nix-channel --update
```

The Nix code in the channels is unpacked into `~/.nix-defexpr/channels` where it can be found by legacy CLI commands such as `nix-env`.

You can find more information about channels in the [Nix manual][manual].

## Examples of channels

| Channel URL                    | Release date                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `channel:nixos-22.11`          | Initially released in November of 2022 and updated for 6 months afterwards | A stable version of NixOS, released in November of 2022. Security patches and updates will be backported, but no new applications, or breaking changes will be applied                                                             |
| `channel:nixos-unstable`       | Frequently updated                                                         | A rolling release channel of NixOS, which is updated whenever a set of important packages builds on Hydra. Security updates, new packages, and new modules will frequently appear on your computer, and breaking changes may occur |
| `channel:nixos-unstable-small` | Same as `nixos-unstable`, but even more frequently                         | A rolling release channel similar to `nixos-unstable` but with a smaller set of packages that are tested. This means this channel is updated more frequently, but may have some broken packages on it as well                      |

## The problem with `nix-channel`

The problem with channels is that they do not provide any guarantees about what inputs are actually used in a particular build.
A channel URL such as `channel:nixos-22.11` can contain different Nix code at different points in time.
As such source [pinning] and rollbacks are much harder with channels.

This means that while Nix is [reproducible] in theory, in practise inputs to builds can frequently change, and a build may fail because of this.
This can cause you to be unable to update your NixOS system, or build a package that previously could be built.

**Because of this the use of Nix channels is highly discouraged!**
