[FlakeHub] is a platform for discovering and publishing [Nix flakes][flakes] built by [Determinate Systems][detsys].
It offers a wide variety of features that Nix on its own does not:

* [Semantic versioning][semver] for flakes, including version modifiers like `~` (flexible patch) and `=` (exact match).
* The ability to explore the Nix flake landscape in a variety of ways:
  * Plaintext search
  * [All flakes][all-flakes]
  * [All organizations][all-orgs]
  * Via labels such as [`nixos`][label-nixos] or [`rust`][label-rust]
* Automated flake [publishing] with GitHub Actions, including a user-friendly [wizard] to help you construct an Actions configuration for your project.

FlakeHub also offers a CLI tool called [`fh`][fh] that you can use to perform a variety of actions against the FlakeHub API.

<Admonition info open title="FlakeHub is a proprietary platform" client:load>
Although we at [Determinate Systems][detsys] believe that FlakeHub makes important aspects of using [Nix flakes][flakes] much easier&mdash;and more fun!&mdash;it is a proprietary platform and mostly not open source.
Most of FlakeHub's features are free, including [semantic versioning][semver] and publishing [public flakes][visibility]

In other words, you can use [Nix] and [Nix flakes][flakes] without using FlakeHub just as you can use [Git] without using [GitHub].
