A *Nix channel* is a release branch for some Nix code, which follows a particular policy.
This can either be a branch, a release tag, or a single commit.
Sounds confusing?
Channels are best explained with some examples!

| Channel name           | Release date                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nixos-22.11`          | Initially release in November of 2022 and updated for 6 months afterwards    | A stable version of NixOS, released in November of 2022. Security patches and updates will be backported, but no new applications, or breaking changes will be applied                                        |
| `nixos-unstable`       | Frequently updated, whenever a set of important packages builds on `staging` | The rolling release channel of NixOS, which is updated whenever its feasible to do so. Security updates, new packages, and breaking changes will frequently appear on your computer                    |
| `nixos-unstable-small` | Same as `nixos-unstable`, but more frequently                                | A rolling release channel similar to `nixos-unstable` but with a smaller set of packages that are tested. This means this channel is updated more frequently, but may have some broken packages on it as well |

Of course, any git reference can be used as a channel.
Channels are now mostly relevant as flake inputs.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs-stable = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-22.11";
    nixpkgs-unstable = "gihub:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };
}
```

## The problem with `nix-channel`

The *legacy* way to update nixpkgs and other sources is via the `nix-channel` command.
The problem with this approach is that `nix-channel` does not provide any guarantees about what inputs are actually used in a particular build.
As such source [pinning](/concepts/pinning) and rollbacks are much harder with nix-channels.

This means that while Nix is [reproducible](/concepts/reproducibility) in theory, in practise inputs to builds can frequently change, and a build may fail because of this.
This can cause you to be unable to update your NixOS system, or build a package that previously could be built.

**Because of this the use of nix channels is highly discouraged!**
