Nix **flakes** are a way of organizing and referring to Nix code that's pretty awesome. We think they're better than [channels](/concepts/channels).

Flakes take [flake inputs](/concepts/flake-inputs), such as [Nixpkgs](/concepts/nixpkgs), and provide [flake outputs](/concepts/flake-outputs) that other flakes can consume.

## Flake references

Flake URLs have this structure:

<FlakeURLs client:only />

Special cases:

<SpecialCases client:only />
