*Nix* refers to a few different things:

1. The pure and functional [programming language][lang]
2. The [Nix CLI](#cli)
3. The overall Nix package management system

## The Nix CLI \{#cli}

There are two different Nix CLIs currently active:

* The [unified Nix CLI](#unified-cli) is currently experimental but, from the standpoint of [Determinate Systems][ds], recommended for using Nix.
  It wraps all Nix functionality into a single `nix` executable and supports [flakes]
* The [original Nix CLI](#original-cli), which is currently standard but, from the standpoint of [Determinate Systems][ds], *not* recommended for using Nix.

### The unified CLI \{#unified-cli}

The *unified CLI* is a still-experimental way of using Nix that involves just one executable called `nix`.
*All* Nix functionality is wrapped into this tool, including commands like `nix build` for building [packages], `nix develop` for activating Nix [development environments][env], `nix store` for managing the [Nix store][store], and more.
Because the unified CLI isn't yet official, it needs to be explicitly enabled in your Nix configuration by adding `nix-command` to your `experimental-features` list.

We won't cover setting up the unified CLI here because [Nix Installer][install] installs both installs it and enables it in your Nix configuration.

### The original CLI \{#original-cli}

The *original CLI* for Nix is still the official CLI but, as we mention above, not recommended for new Nix users for two reasons:

1. It's incompatible with [Nix flakes][flakes] as it was created before the inception of flakes.
1. It presents significant cognitive overhead in comparison with the [unified CLI](#unified-cli) because it requires you to learn a wide variety of CLI tools, including `nix-build` for building [packages], `nix-shell` for Nix [development environments][env], `nix-store` for managing the [Nix store][store], and several more.

[Nix Installer][install] installs only the [unified CLI](#unified-cli) and *none* of the tools from the original CLI.
