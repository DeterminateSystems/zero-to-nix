*Nix* refers to a few different things:

1. The pure and functional [programming language](/concepts/nix-language)
2. The set of `nix` and `nix-*` commandline-tools
3. The overall Nix package management system


## The Nix commands

There are two sets of nix commands:

- those that follow the `nix-*` pattern (for example `nix-build` or `nix-shell`).  These commands are generally used to interact with _legacy Nix systems_
- the `nix <command>` CLI, which supports flakes and will eventually replace all legacy style commands.  Currently not _all_ operations are supported by this tool (for example `nix-copy-closure`)
