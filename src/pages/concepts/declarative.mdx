In software, **declarative** logic means saying what you want and then the software goes and does it without you having to worry about the steps.

For the most part, Nix follows declarative principles...

[Derivations](/concepts/derivations) are an exception to declarativity in Nix because, well, you gotta build stuff sometimes.

Declarative approaches are typically contrasted with [imperative] approaches that are, like, clearly worse.
