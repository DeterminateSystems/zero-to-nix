*Reproducibility* is a software design concept, where an operation for the same inputs yields the same output.
This is an important property for Nix, because hashes are based on the inputs of a build,
and thus it must be guaranteed that the same inputs yield in the same build output.

```nix
{ stdenv, fetchGit }:
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "my-package";
  src = fetchgit {
    url = "https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/riff";
    sha256 = "sha256-7mnx7J0AacL2P2mNuNNB+kKE7VR8nniVG+PSrwpZixE=";
  };
}
```

The above code consists of _two_ derivations: `fetchgit` and `mkDerivation`.

The reproducibility of `mkDerivation` is guaranteed because the output of `fetchgit` is pinned to a particular hash.
And because `mkDerivation` itself isn't allowed to touch the network, and is [hermetically](/concepts/hermiticity) sealed from the host, no impurities in the build can exist.

The output of `fetchgit` is guaranteed because its output is fixed to a particular hash.
While it *can* touch the network, it will fail to build if the output from the fetch doesn't match the user-provided output hash.

You can see how the reproducibility of Nix builds are layered, like a packaging onion.
