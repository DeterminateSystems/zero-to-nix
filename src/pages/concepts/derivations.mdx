In Nix, a *derivation* is a set of instructions for building a [package](/concepts/package).
Each derivation can depend on other derivations and produce one or more final outputs.

The most common outputs are:

- `out`, the most generic one
- `lib`, for library outputs
- `dev`, general development resources such as header files
- `man`, for manual pages

A derivation and all of the dependencies required to build it&mdash;direct dependencies, and all dependencies of those dependencies, etc&mdash;is called a *package closure*.
