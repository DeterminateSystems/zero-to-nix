*Realisation* is the process whereby a Nix [derivation] is transformed into a [package].
Where a derivation is essentially a plan for a package, realisation is the build process turns that plan into an actual output directory full of content.

## `.drv` files

When you run [`nix build`][nix-build] to build a package, the Nix CLI first looks at the [`derivation`][derivation] function for the function and transforms it into an intermediate [`.drv` file][drv], which is essentially a formal representation of the `derivation` function.
All `.drv` files are stored in the [Nix store][store] with a hashed path, such as `/nix/store/m2nb4d0pfydr8bq5ww1yqbrkvvf18zbl-perl-5.36.0.drv`, which ensures that *any* change in a `derivation` function results in a new `.drv` file with a new path.
The CLI then uses the `.drv` file as the blueprint for the actual build process, which always builds the package's entire dependency tree.

## The build process

Once Nix has built a `.drv` file for the derivation, it uses the encoded instructions in the file to actually build the package in a [sandboxed] environment, which essentially means that realisation doesn't rely on or affect any global state on your machine, such as configuration files in `/etc`.
Everything required for the build process is drawn from:

1. The build instructions in the derivation, for example commands like `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`, and `mv`.
1. Artifacts from the [Nix store][store].
  If you write a derivation with [Git] as a build input, for example, the realisation process builds Git and stores the resulting package in the [Nix store][store] (if it isn't already built and stored there) and uses that package when the `git` command is invoked in the build logic, rather than a "global" Git at a path like `/usr/bin/git`.
