*Flake outputs* are what a flake produces as part of its build.
Each flake can have many different outputs simultaneously, including but not limited to,
application [packages](/concepts/package),
system configuration,
hydra build jobs (CI),
and [shell environments](/concepts/dev-env).

Flake outputs are defined by a function, which takes an attribute set as input,
containing each of the inputs to that flake (named after the chosen identifier in the [inputs](/concepts/flake-inputs) section).

The flake output below, for example, produces a single package output on `x86_64-linux` systems for the `cowsay` derivation.

```nix filename=flake.nix
{
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let system = x86_64-linux;
  in
  {
    packages."${system}".default = (import nixpkgs { inherit system; }).cowsay;
  };
}
```
