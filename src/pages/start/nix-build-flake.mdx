In the [last guide][prev], we built a Nix package defined in [Nixpkgs] to get a sense of some of the mechanics of that process.
In this guide, we'll dig a bit deeper and build a Nix package defined in a local [Nix flake][flake].

First, select a preferred language:

<Languages client:load />

To get started in your <Language client:load /> project, create an empty directory and initialize a [flake template][templates]:

<Shell client:load />

## Building the package

Whichever language you've selected, you can build the [Nix package][packages] defined in the local flake by running:

```shell
nix build
```

This command determines that the local flake has a [package output][outputs], which is a [derivation] that defines how the package is built.
In this particular flake there's a `default` package, which enables us to run `nix build` without specifying an output, but if the package were output as `packages.mypkg`, for example, we'd need to run `nix build .#mypkg` to build it.

<SpecificLanguage lang="JavaScript" client:load>
Here's the package definition that builds our JavaScript package:

```nix filename=flake.nix
{
  packages.default = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = "zero-to-nix-javascript";

    # The packages required by the build process
    buildInputs = [
      pkgs.nodePackages.pnpm
      pkgs.nodejs-18_x
    ];

    # The code sources for the package
    src = ./.;

    # The build process
    buildPhase = ''
      pnpm install
      pnpm run build
    '';

    # How the output of the build phase
    installPhase = ''
      mkdir $out
      cp dist/index.html $out
    '';
  }
}
```

For the full flake, see [`flake.nix`][flake-js] on GitHub or run `cat flake.nix`.
What you see here is a [derivation] that defines how to build the package, more specifically the `mkDerivation` function provided by Nix's [standard environment][stdenv].

The package that results when you run `nix build` is a website built using the [Vite] framework.
To view that website:

```shell
open ./result/index.html
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage lang="Python" client:load>
Here's the package definition that enables us to build our Python package:

```nix filename=flake.nix
 packages.default = python.pkgs.buildPythonApplication {
  name = "zero-to-nix-python";

  buildInputs = with python.pkgs; [ pip ];

  src = ./.;
};
```

For the full flake, see [`flake.nix`][flake-py] on GitHub or run `cat flake.nix`.
What you see here is a [derivation] that defines how to build the package, more specifically the [`buildPythonApplication`][buildpythonapplication] function, which is a wrapper around Nix's built-in `derivation` function.

The package that results when you run `nix build` is a website built using the [Vite] framework.
To run the package:

```shell
./result/bin/zero-to-nix-python
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage lang="Go" client:load>
Here's the package definition that enables us to build this Go package:

```nix filename=flake.nix
packages.default = pkgs.buildGoModule {
  name = "zero-to-nix-go";
  src = gitignore.lib.gitignoreSource ./.;
  vendorSha256 = "sha256-fwJTg/HqDAI12mF1u/BlnG52yaAlaIMzsILDDZuETrI=";
};
```

For the full flake, see [`flake.nix`][flake-go] on GitHub or run `cat flake.nix`.
What you see here is a [derivation] that defines how to build the package, more specifically the [`buildGoModule`][buildgomodule] function, which is a wrapper around Nix's built-in `derivation` function.

The package that results when you run `nix build` is a web server built using the [Gi] framework.
To run the package:

```shell
./result/bin/zero-to-nix-go
```

In another window, run `curl http://localhost:8080` to receive a message from the server.
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage lang="Rust" client:load>
Here's the package definition that enables us to build this Rust package:

```nix filename=flake.nix
 packages.default = pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {
  name = "zero-to-nix-rust";
  src = ./.;
  cargoLock = {
    lockFile = ./Cargo.lock;
  };
};
```

For the full flake, see [`flake.nix`][flake-go] on GitHub or run `cat flake.nix`.
What you see here is a [derivation] that defines how to build the package, more specifically the [`buildRustPackage`][buildrustpackage] function, which is a wrapper around Nix's built-in `derivation` function.

To run the resulting package, which is an executable that prints to the terminal:

```shell
./result/bin/zero-to-nix-rust
```

You should see this terminal output:

```text
Hello from Nix + Rust!
```
</SpecificLanguage>

We won't delve too much deeper into [derivations][derivation] and creating your own packages here, but we hope that this guide shows you how Nix code gets turned into real build output.
