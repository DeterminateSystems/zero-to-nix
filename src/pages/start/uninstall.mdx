  "Use [Harmonic](/concepts/harmonic) to cleanly remove Nix from your system"

At the beginning of the Zero to Nix quick start, we [installed] Nix using [Harmonic], an unofficial Nix installer from [Determinate Systems][ds].
If you need to uninstall Nix for any reason, you can do so with one command.

```shell
sudo harmonic uninstall
```

<Admonition type="warning">
The `harmonic uninstall` command needs to be run as root, as in the code block above.
</Admonition>

Once you've done that, you can verify that the `/nix` directory has been removed from your system:

```shell
ls /
```

[ds]: https://determinate.systems
[harmonic]: /concepts/harmonic
[installed]: /start/install
