**Welcome!** . It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix]!
This guide explains how to install Nix on your system, followed by a
simple examples of running a program with Nix. Let‚Äôs get right into
it‚Ä¶

<Systems client:only />

First, download our Nix installer <Snippet id="harmonic"
show="Harmonic" client:only="react" />.  This is not yet the official
installer for Nix/ NixOS, however this will probably change in the
future.

```shell
$ curl https://harmonic.dev | sh
```

Harmonic follows different steps based on the *build plan* you select.

Currently there are only two: *linux-multi* (for 64bit Linux systems)
and *darwin-multi* (for 64bit Intel and ARM macOS systems).  The
*-multi* refers to the type of installation being performed
(i.e. [‚Äúmulti-user‚Äù]).

If this seems confusing, don‚Äôt worry about it too much for now. We
will go into the technical side of what a Nix installation entails in
the **Concepts** section of this guide.

Once Harmonic has finished you should verify the installation by running:

```bash
$ nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the *nix* command.

Alternatively you can run the following command to get a friendly
message appear in your terminal üôÇ

```
$ echo "Hello Nix" | nix run github:nixos/nixpkgs#cowsay
___________ 
< Hello Nix >
 ----------- 
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Read onto the next section to learn what this last command just did!
