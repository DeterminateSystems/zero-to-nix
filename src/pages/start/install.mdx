**Welcome**!
It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix].
In this [quick start][start], we'll get Nix installed on your system and provide you with a small taste of Nix's feature set by accomplishing some practical things, such as [creating a development environment][dev] and [building a package][build] using Nix.

To begin, let us know which system you're working with:

<Systems client:load />

## Download the installer \{#download}

Before installing Nix, download [Harmonic], a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system:

```shell
curl -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sudo sh -s -- install
```

<Admonition title="Why aren't we using the official Nix installer here?" type="info" id="why-harmonic" client:load>
We believe that Harmonic provides a smoother experience for people who are new to Nix than the [official Nix installer][official].
Unlike many tools, Nix needs to make several bold changes to your system in order to work properly, such as creating a new root volume in the `/nix` directory, configuring your shell profile, and creating several new system users and groups.

Harmonic improves on the official Nix installer by enabling you to undo, with a single command, all of the system changes introduced by Harmonic's Nix installation process.
It also installs Nix with [Nix flakes][flakes] enabled, while the official installer requires you to enable flakes manually.

See the [Uninstalling Nix][uninstall] guide if you need to uninstall Nix or the [Harmonic] concept if you'd like more background.

## Plan your installation \{#plan}

With Harmonic installed, you can *plan* your Nix installation:

<Harmonic command="plan" client:load />

This [JSON] object produced by the `plan` command is a *receipt* that details the changes that the installation process will introduce.

<Admonition title="Multi-user mode" type="info" id="harmonic-multi" client:load>
The `multi` in the `plan` command above indicates that Harmonic will install Nix in *multi-user mode* as opposed to single-user mode.
Multi-user mode prevents non-`root` users from modifying the [Nix store][store] directly, instead forwarding Nix-store-modifying operations to a Nix daemon (this daemon is also installed and started by Harmonic).
Harmonic currently only supports multi-user mode.

For a more detailed treatment, see the [Nix manual][multi].
</Admonition>

Remember that you can [uninstall] Nix and undo all changes made by Harmonic at any time.

## Install Nix

Without further ado, you can now install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:load />

Follow the prompts to approve the requested changes to your system one by one.
Once Harmonic has finished, load the Nix executable into your `PATH`:

```shell
exec $SHELL
```

Now verify that installation has succeeded:

```bash
nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the `nix` command.

**Congrats**!
You now have Nix installed and ready to go on your system.
You're now ready to use Nix to run programs.
