[Nix] enables you to create [development environments][dev] that are "sealed" from the rest of your system&mdash;they ignore directories like `/usr/bin` and only use packages available in the [Nix store][store].
To get started, tell us which language you prefer:

<Languages client:load />

To get started in your <Language client:load /> project, create an empty directory and initialize a [flake templates][templates]:

<Shell client:load />

Once the template has been initialized, run `ls .` to see the contents of the directory, which should include two important files:

- The `flake.nix` file defines the [flake][flakes] for your project.
- The `flake.lock` [pins][pinning] all of the [flake inputs][inputs]&mdash;essentially the Nix dependencies&mdash;in your `flake.nix` file to specific [Git revisions][rev].

## Exploring a Nix development environment for <Language client:load /> \{#language-env}

One of the [flake outputs][outputs] of this Nix [flakes] is a [development environment][dev] for <Language client:load />.
To enter that development environment:

```shell
nix develop
```

Now that we've entered the development environment, we can do some exploring, starting with [Nix store paths][store].

<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="JavaScript">
Ordinarily when you run `which node` on a Unix system, you get a path like `/usr/bin/node`.
Try running it in the Nix development environment:

```shell
which node
```

You should see a (rather strange) path like this:

```shell
/nix/store/i88kh2fd03f5fsd3a948s19gliggd2wd-nodejs-18.12.1/bin/node
```

</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Python">
Ordinarily when you run `which python` on a Unix system, you get a path like `/usr/bin/python`.
Try running it in the Nix development environment:

```shell
which python
```

You should see a (rather strange) path like this:

```shell
/nix/store/cqbfx55481irqgbl3bw8jwf69vjpbp8r-python3-3.9.15/bin/python
```

</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Go">
Ordinarily when you run `which go` on a Unix system, you get a path like `/usr/bin/go`.
Try running it in the Nix development environment:

```shell
which go
```

You should see a (rather strange) path like this:

```shell
/nix/store/hvnp4a2wlqhfx6yfvfm4zw0vxh3jadzh-go-1.19.3/bin/go
```

</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Rust">
Ordinarily when you run `which cargo` on a Unix system, you get a path like `/usr/bin/cargo`.
Try running it in the Nix development environment:

```shell
which cargo
```

You should see a (rather strange) path like this:

```shell
/nix/store/zc1nr87147gvmg5nqci8q5cfnzg82vwp-rust-default-1.64.0/bin/cargo
```
</SpecificLanguage>

Probably not what you expected! What happened here? A few things:

- Nix looked at the `devShells` [flake outputs][outputs] in `flake.nix` to figure out which [Nix packages][packages] to include in the development environment (Nix specifically looked at the `buildInputs` array).
- Nix built the packages specified under `buildInputs` and stored them in the
  [Nix store][store] under `/nix/store`.
