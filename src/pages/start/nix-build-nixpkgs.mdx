While [Nix] can do many things, [package management][pkg] is the thing that it's perhaps best known for. In this tutorial, we'll use our [installed Nix CLI][install] to build and run some Nix [packages] included in [Nixpkgs]. Later in the [quick start][start] we'll build and run a Nix package defined in a local [flake].

## Our first package

Let's start by building [bat], a syntax-highlighted version of [cat] written in [Rust], using Nix:

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#bat"
```

Here, `nixpkgs` is a [flake reference][flake] to the [NixOS/nixpkgs][nixpkgs-repo] repository on GitHub, while `#bat` indicates that we're building the `bat` output from the Nixpkgs flake.

When the build is done, run `ls .` and you should see something called `result` in the current directory. `result` is actually a [symlink] to the built package in the [Nix store][store], which you can verify:

```shell
readlink result
```

You should see a path like this (it's likely to be a bit different on your machine):

<NixStorePath pkg="bat-0.22.1" />

What's happened here is that the Nix CLI has:

* Downloaded the Nix code in [Nixpkgs]
* Found the [derivation][derivations] with the name `bat` (code [here][nixpkgs-bat])
* Used the build instructions in the derivation to build the package
* Stored the result in the [Nix store][store] using Nix's hash-based path system

You can now run bat:

```shell
./result/bin/bat --help
```

Congrats! You've built and run a package using Nix.

## Build a package written in `$LANGUAGE` \{#language-specific}

One of the great things about Nix is that [derivations] are extremely flexible, which enables you to create packages for things written in just about any programming language. In this section, we'll explore that by building and running packages for tools written in a variety of languages. Select one below to see some examples:

<Languages client:load />

<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="JavaScript">
Let's build and run [npm]:

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#nodePackages.npm"
./result/bin/npm --help
```

If you run `ls result/bin` you'll notice that the package also includes [npx].
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Python">
Let's build and run [pip]:

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#pythonPackages.pip"
./result/bin/pip --help
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Go">
Let's build and run [kubectl]:

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#kubectl"
./result/bin/kubectl --help
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Rust">
Let's build and run [ripgrep]:

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#ripgrep"
./result/bin/ripgrep --help
```
</SpecificLanguage>

## Beyond Nixpkgs

While [Nixpkgs] is by far the largest Nix package repository in the known universe, any [Nix flake][flake] can include package [outputs]. Let's build a package from a different repo, this time the package for [Home Manager][hm], a popular Nix tool for configuring home environments:

```shell
nix build "github:nix-community/home-manager"
```

Here, `github:nix-community/home-manager` is a flake reference to the [nix-community/home-manager][hm] repo on GitHub. To run Home Manager:

```shell
./result/bin/home-manager --help
```

Upstreaming your packages to Nixpkgs is always an option, but it's good to bear in mind that with Nix you can distribute packages via any public Git repository with a [`flake.nix`][flake].
