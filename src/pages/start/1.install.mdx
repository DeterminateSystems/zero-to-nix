<Admonition success open title="The target audience for the quick start" id="quick-start-audience" client:load>
We wrote this [Zero to Nix][z2n] quick start with one specific audience in mind: people who have heard about [Nix] but don't yet know much about it and aren't quite sure where to start with the learning process.
It's intended less as a how-to guide for using Nix in your everyday workflows and more to provide a glimpse into Nix's feature set and to provide some of those "a-ha!" moments that make you feel empowered to go further.

If you're already fairly familiar with Nix and are looking for specific guidance on using it in your day job, you may still get some value out of the quick start but you may be better served with more practical, guide-driven resources like [nix.dev].
</Admonition>

**Welcome**!
It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix].
In this [quick start][start], we'll get Nix installed on your system and provide you with a small taste of Nix's feature set by accomplishing some practical things, such as [creating a development environment][dev] and [building a package][build] using Nix.

## Install Nix \{#up}

We recommend installing Nix using [Nix installer][nix-installer], a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system.
Nix Installer supports these platforms:

* Multi-user Linux with [systemd] init on 64-bit ARM and 64-bit AMD/Intel (no [SELinux])
* Multi-user macOS on 64-bit ARM and 64-bit AMD/Intel
* [Valve Steam Deck][steamdeck]

To run Nix Installer:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

If you have concerns about the "curl to Bash" approach you have two options:

1. You can download a binary for the most recent version of Nix Installer directly from the [releases] page and run it.
1. You can examine the installation script [here][script] then download and run it:

    ```shell
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix > nix-installer.sh
    chmod +x nix-installer.sh
    ./nix-installer.sh install
    ```

<Admonition info title="Why aren't we using the official Nix installation script here?" id="why-nix-installer" client:load>
We believe that Nix Installer provides a smoother experience for people who are new to Nix than the [official Nix installation script][official].
Unlike many tools, Nix needs to make several changes to your system in order to work properly, such as creating a new `/nix` directory, configuring your shell profile, and creating several new system users and groups.

Nix Installer improves on the official Nix installation script by enabling you to undo, with a single command, all of the system changes introduced by Nix Installer's installation process.
It also installs Nix with [Nix flakes][flakes] enabled, while the official installer requires you to enable flakes manually.

See the [Uninstalling Nix][uninstall] guide if you need to uninstall Nix or the [Nix Installer][nix-installer] concept doc if you'd like more background.
</Admonition>

Validate the displayed plan and approve it to begin the installation process.
Once Nix Installer has finished, you should see `Nix was installed successfully!` in your terminal.

Open a new terminal session and the `nix` executable should be in your `$PATH`.
To verify that:

```bash
nix --version
```

This should print the version information for Nix.

:rocket: **Success**!
You now have Nix installed and ready to go on your system.
