One of Nix's key features for developing software is Nix [development environments][dev].
You can define development environments of any complexity using the [Nix language][language].
We'll cover that a bit later, but for now let's get a feel for what a Nix development environment is and how it works.

The [`nix develop`][nix-develop] command activates a Nix environment:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example"
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="This could take a while" id="nix-develop-loading" client:load>
The first time you activate a Nix development environment using `nix develop` it's likely to be a slow operation.
That's because Nix needs to build every [package][packages] included in the environment from scratch.
This is in contrast to most [package managers][pkg], which install things more quickly because they download pre-built archives like tarballs.
Future `nix develop` invocations should be much faster, as Nix doesn't need to build the packages again.
</Admonition>

You should be greeted with this:

```shell
Welcome to a Nix development environment!
bash-5.1$
```

Congrats 🚀! You're now in a [Bash] environment that includes [curl] and [Git].
You may already have both in your environment, but run these commands to see that something new is happening:

```shell
which curl
which git
```

For curl, for example, you should see a strange path like this (the input hash part should be different on your machine):

<NixStorePath pkg="curl-7.86.0-bin" bin="curl" />

What happened here? The [Nix] CLI did a few things:

* It used the `github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix` [flake reference][flakes] to pull in some Nix code and targeted a specific [flake output][output] (more on this later).
* It built the [packages] specified in the environment configuration (again, more on this later).
* It [symlinked] those package paths to `curl` and `git`, respectively.

But those symlinks are only valid in your current directory. If you run `cd ..` and then `which git`, you should no longer see a Nix store path.

A few other things:

* The `Welcome to a Nix development environment!` greeting is defined in the *shell hook*. This is arbitrary code that you can run when the environment starts up.
* Nix development environments support environment variables as well. Run `echo $SECRET_PASSWORD` to access a value that's available only in the Nix environment.

Let's leave the Nix development environment:

```shell
exit
```

Now check the path for [Git] using `which git`. It should be at a global system path like `/usr/bin/git`.
And if you run `echo $SECRET_PASSWORD` again you should get an empty string (unless you happen to have that set on your machine!).

## Run commands inside the development environment

While it's fun to explore the environment, you don't always want to be inside the environment to use it.
The `nix develop` command provides a `--command` (or `-c`) flag that you can use to run commands that *use* the environment but *from* your current environment.
Here are some examples for the environment we used earlier:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example" --command git status
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example" --command curl https://example.com
```

In both cases, you're running a symlinked package in the [Nix store][store] and nothing from your global environment.
As you can see, Nix development environments are [*hermetic*][hermeticity] in that they're isolated from the surrounding environment (such as your environment variables and paths like `/bin` and `/usr/bin`).

## Language-specific environments

As we did in the [last section][last], let's get a bit more specific and explore how Nix can benefit more specific programming environments.
Select one of these programming languages:

<Languages client:load />

Now explore the Nix development environment for <Language client:load />:

<NixDevelop client:load />

<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="JavaScript">
First, let's see the Nix store paths for [Node.js]:

```shell
which node
```

Now use Node to run a program:

```shell
node --eval "console.log('1 + 1 = ' + (1 + 1))"
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Python">
First, let's see the Nix store path for Python:

```shell
which python
```

Now use Python to run a program:

```shell
python -c "print(1 + 1)"
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Go">
First, let's see the Nix store path for the [Go] CLI:

```shell
which go
```

Now check the Go version:

```shell
go --version
```

You should get 1.19.3.
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Rust">
First, let's see the Nix store path for [cargo]:

```shell
which cargo
```

Now create a [Rust] project in the current directory and run the example:

```shell
cargo init .
cargo run
```

You should see `Hello, world!`.
</SpecificLanguage>

## Beyond language-specific environments

In the [previous section](#language-specific-environments), we explored Nix environments tailored to specific programming languages.
But Nix environments are infinitely flexible, enabling you to combine whichever packages you like.
Let's explore an example of this:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#multi"
```

This Nix environment has several tools available:

* [Python]
* [kubectl]
* [Terraform]
* [OpenSSL]

As in the previous examples, you can run commands like `which python` and `which kubectl` to see that these tools are all symlinked to the [Nix store][store] and thus that your Nix
This list could easily include 100 packages.
It's up to you.
We won't cover *how* to create these environments just yet, but we hope that you come away from this guide with a basic sense of what Nix development environments provide.
