In the last section, we installed Nix using the [Determinate Nix Installer][nix-installer].
Now we can dive in and use Nix to run an actual program.
Let's try running the delightful [ponysay]:

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "nixpkgs#ponysay"
```

:rocket: **Success**!
You should see a charming equine greeting in your console.

<Admonition warning title="This could take a while" id="nix-run-loading" client:load>
The first time you run a program using `nix run` it's likely to be a slow operation.
That's because Nix needs to build the program's [package][packages] from scratch&mdash;or download it from a known [cache]&mdash;and store it in the [Nix store][store].
This is in contrast to most [package managers][pkg], which install things more quickly because they download pre-built archives like tarballs.
Future `nix run` invocations should be instantaneous, as Nix doesn't need to build the package again.

## Explanation

What happened here? The [Nix] CLI did a few things:

* It used the `nixpkgs` [flake reference][ref] to pull in some Nix code and targeted the `ponysay` [flake output][output] (more on this later).
* It built the [`ponysay` package][ponysay] and stored the result in the [Nix store][store].
* It ran the executable at `bin/ponysay` from the `ponysay` package.

In Nix, every program is part of a [package][packages].
Packages are built using the [Nix language][derivations].
The `ponysay` package has a single program (also called `ponysay`) but packages can contain multiple programs as well as man pages, configuration files, and more.
The [`ffmpeg`][ffmpeg-pkg] package, for example, provides both [ffmpeg] and [ffprobe].

You may have noticed that [`nix run`][nix-run] doesn't require anything like a `nix install` command.
This makes it handy for use cases like shell scripting or experimenting with in-progress tools.

**Congrats**!
You've just run a program using the Nix CLI and learned a little bit about some core Nix concepts.
You're now ready to explore Nix development environments.
