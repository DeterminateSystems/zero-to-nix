Hi there! In the last section we covered a basic Nix installation with
**Harmonic**. At this point in the guide you should be able to run
this command to get a friendly message in your terminal:

```
$ echo "Hello Nix" | nix run github:nixos/nixpkgs#cowsay
```

This guide expands on the idea of running programs with Nix, and
introduces you to some concepts such as **packages** and
**flakes**. Let’s go!

Every program in Nix is contained by a package (also sometimes called
**Derivations**). A package can contain different **outputs** around
the same program (for example `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are both provided
in the `ffmpeg` package).

A flake is a collection of Nix packages. You can think of a flake as
an index of what packages are available to you. **Nixpkgs** is the
main and official NixOS package collection with over 80’000 packages!
But many other flakes exist, for example **foo** and **bar**.

To break down the command above:

- `echo "Hello Nix" |` — prints the string “Hello Nix” and pipes it to
  the next application in the chain
- `nix run` — this command will run a single program from a provided
  flake
- `github:nixos/nixpkgs` — this is the flakes URL for **nixpgs**, the
  official NixOS package repository.
- `#cowsay` — select the **cowsay** output of the provided flake. The
  `#` syntax is used to separate the flake URL from the package output
