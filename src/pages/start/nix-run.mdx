In the last section, we installed Nix using [Nix Installer][nix-installer].
Now we can dive in and use Nix to run an actual program:

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "nixpkgs#cowsay"
```

You should see this:

```shell
___________
< Hello Nix >
 -----------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="This could take a while" id="nix-run-loading" client:load>
The first time you run a program using `nix run` it's likely to be a slow operation.
That's because Nix needs to build the program's [package] from scratch&mdash;or download it from a known cache&mdash;and store it in the [Nix store][store].
This is in contrast to most [package managers][pkg], which install things more quickly because they download pre-built archives like tarballs.
Future `nix run` invocations should be instantaneous, as Nix doesn't need to build the package again.

## Explanation

What happened here? The [Nix] CLI did a few things:

* It used the `nixpkgs#cowsay` [flake reference][flakes] to pull in some Nix code and targeted a specific [flake output][output] (more on this later).
* It built the [`cowsay` package][cowsay] and stored the result in the [Nix store][store].
* It ran the executable at `bin/cowsay` from the `cowsay` package.

In Nix, every program is part of a [package].
Packages are built using special functions in the [Nix language][lang] called [derivations].
The `cowsay` package has a single program (also called `cowsay`), but packages can contain multiple programs as well as man pages, configuration files, and more.
The [`ffmpeg`][ffmpeg-pkg] package, for example, provides both [ffmpeg] and [ffprobe].

**Congrats**!
You've just run a program using the Nix CLI and learned a little bit about some core Nix concepts.
You're now ready to explore Nix development environments.
