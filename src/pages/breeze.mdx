We wrote this [Zero to Nix][z2n] breeze with one specific audience in mind: people who have heard about [Nix] but don't yet know much about it and aren't quite sure where to start with the learning process.
In this one-page guide, we'll [install Nix](#up) and use it to do some things that people often do with Nix, such as [running a program](#run) without needing to install it, using a [Nix development environment](#develop), [building](#build) a Nix [package]

If you're intrigued and would like to go further, check out the [quick start][start].
</Admonition>

## Get Nix running \{#up}

First, install [Nix] using the [Determinate Nix Installer][installer], an unofficial and experimental tool from [Determinate Systems][ds]:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Our installer supports [several platforms][platforms].

## Run

Nix enables you to [run] programs without a separate installation step.
This runs [ponysay], one of the many packages available in [Nixpkgs]:

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "nixpkgs#ponysay"
```

<Admonition warning title="This could take a while" id="nix-run-loading" client:load>
The first time you run a program using `nix run` it's likely to be a slow operation.
Subsequent runs should be instantaneous.
</Admonition>

Let's try a slightly more realistic example and use [bat] to render some Markdown in our terminal:

```shell
echo '# Hello, Nix!\n\nSo happy to be here.' > hello.md
nix run "nixpkgs#bat" -- hello.md
rm hello.md # let's clean up after ourselves
```

## Develop

Running programs in a one-off way is good for experimentation, but more often you'll want to create [development environments][dev-env] for specific projects.
Run this to activate one:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example"
```

<Admonition warning title="This could take a while" id="nix-develop-loading" client:load>
The first time you activate a development environment using `nix develop` it's likely to be a slow operation.
Subsequent activations should be much speedier.
</Admonition>

This development environment provides specific versions of [curl], [jq], and [Git].
You should enter a shell with this prompt:

```shell
(nix:zero-to-nix-env) bash-5.1$
```

Run `type git` to see where Git

## Build

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#bat"
```

## Install

```shell
nix profile install "nixpkgs#ponysay"
```

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | ponysay
```

## Uninstall Nix \{#uninstall}

While we'd love for you to keep using Nix, you can uninstall it at any time if you need to:

```shell
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

<Admonition success client:load>
The ability to seamlessly uninstall Nix from your system is one of the differentiating features of the [Determinate Nix Installer][dni].
If you install Nix using the [official installer][official], by contrast, you'd need to uninstall Nix manually.
