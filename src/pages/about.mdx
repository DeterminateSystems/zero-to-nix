[**Zero to Nix**](/) is a highly opinionated learning resource for [Nix] created by [Determinate Systems][ds]. We created Zero to Nix for two reasons:

1. We find most of the existing [Nix] documentation to be difficult to navigate for beginners.
  Sources like the [Nixpkgs manual][manual], the [official website][nix], [Nix Pills][pills], and semi-official sources like [nix.dev] are all great once you have a strong sense of how Nix works and what it provides.
  We encourage you to explore them and we even link them in many places in Zero to Nix.
  But together they can be daunting to the uninitiated, and we wanted to provide a gentle "front end" to the official documentation sources.
1. We strongly believe that [flakes] are the future of Nix and that people onboarding into Nix should use them from the get-go.
  But flakes are currently marked as an experimental feature of Nix and are thus not discussed in any of the official Nix documentation sources (with the exception of the [Wiki entry][wiki] for flakes).

These things together left us little choice but to proceed on our own outside of official channels.

## What's opinionated about Zero to Nix

First, as mentioned above, Zero to Nix is opinionated because it advocates learning and using [flakes] and treating [channels] as deprecated. But Zero to Nix also deviates from official recommendations in that it recommends installing Nix using [Harmonic] rather than the [official Nix installer][install].

There's nothing *wrong* with the official Nix installer&mdash;far from it!&mdash;and we don't dissuade you from using it. But we feel pretty strongly that Harmonic is more likely to offer a smooth experience for newcomers.
